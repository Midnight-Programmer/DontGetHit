# DontGetHit
Game for Android App Development Class

Written in December, 2022 using the Java language.

This is a very simple game I created for my Android App Development class.
We were given a list of requirements, but the actual game we implemented to fulfil those requirements was up to us.

The objective is to drag a character left and right to avoid falling objects. You gain points for each object avoided, and the game remembers your highest score.
After you get hit three times, your character dies and you can see your scores, start over, or exit.

The graphics and animations are fairly simple, as the goal was more intended towards gaining experience using different features instead of making a polished product.

My main goal with this app was to better learn how to implement intents, game views, and some simple animations.
Also helped reinforce the use of event listeners from previous projects.
